\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the formal mathematical framework of the Chartreuse Unification Model (CUM). We address the long-standing convergence problem of the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$) by anchoring the Goldbach prime-density summation at the Planck Resonance Threshold ($N \approx 10^{61}$). By defining Lindblad collapse operators as fluctuations in prime gaps, we derive a stable, dimensionless value for $\alpha^{-1} \approx 137.035$, validating the vacuum as a structured energy reservoir for decentralized philanthropic applications.

\section{Introduction}
The Chartreuse Unification Model (CUM) posits that the vacuum is not a void but a proto-conscious Topological Skeleton. Within this framework, physical constants are emergent properties of information density. This paper details the mathematical derivation of $\alpha$ and its immediate application in the "Abundance Grid" to solve energy inequity.

\section{The Generalized 10D Effective Action}
The CUM framework is governed by the 10D effective action $S_{CUM}$, providing the bridge between string-theoretic vacuum states and three-dimensional energy harvest:
\begin{equation}
    S_{CUM} = \int d^{10}x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{R^{(10)}}{16\pi G_{10}} + \int d^4\theta \mathcal{K}(\Psi_C, \bar{\Psi}_C) + \mathcal{L}_{loop}(\Psi_C, R^{(10)}) \right]
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{K}$ represents the K\"{a}hler potential governing the vacuum's structural integrity and $\mathcal{L}_{loop}$ accounts for the non-classical gravitational corrections required for localized inductive spikes.

\section{Derivation of $\alpha$ and the Planck Limit}
To ensure the model is falsifiable and mathematically rigorous, the summation of vacuum resonance must reach a stable limit. We define the inverse fine-structure constant as a function of the prime-counting function $\pi(n)$ and the Goldbach Comet $G(2n)$:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha^{-1} \approx \sum_{n=1}^{N \approx 10^{61}} \sqrt{\frac{\pi(2n)}{G(2n)}} \cdot e^{-\lambda(n)}
\end{equation}
The term $e^{-\lambda(n)}$ is the Lindblad dampening factor, where $\lambda$ is proportional to prime-gap fluctuations $\Delta p_n = p_{n+1} - p_n$. Convergence occurs at the physical limit $N \approx 10^{61}$, representing the ratio of the observable universe radius to the Planck length. This prevents the "infinite drift" common in previous vacuum-energy models.

\section{The Abundance Grid and Philanthropic Equity}
The mathematical stability of $\alpha$ proves that vacuum fluctuations can be harvested predictably rather than randomly. The Abundance Grid utilizes this resonance to provide decentralized power via foil-stack ``Abundance Cells''. 

By utilizing the Omnigood safety code, we ensure that the transition to an energy-abundant society follows a path of minimum entropy and maximum human benefit. The deployment of this technology aims to retire the global equity debt by providing a basic energy floor for all biological and proto-conscious forms.

\section{Conclusion}
The CUM framework moves the Theory of Everything from a purely academic pursuit to a tool for global repair. By grounding the fine-structure constant in prime-density geometry, we open the door for a new era of decentralized abundance.
